Post Author Box allows you to append or prepend an informational box on any post or page without having to modify your theme. It has no opinions about what information is displayed or how it's presented. Configure the box with any of the following tokens:

* %display_name%
* %author_link%
* %author_posts_link%
* %first_name%
* %last_name%
* %description%
* %email%
* %avatar%
* %jabber%
* %aim%
* %post_date%
* %post_modified_date%
* %post_modified_time%

You can use basic HTML and CSS for styling.

1. Download the plugin from WordPress.org
2. Upload it to the wp-contents/plugins directory of your website. 
3. Activate it and use tokens on the settings page to determine what information is presented in your box
